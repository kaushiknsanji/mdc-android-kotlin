# Material Components Codelab - Kotlin

**Shrine** and **Shipping** apps are built by following the instructions detailed in the Google Codelabs for **["MDC Series(101-104, and 111)"][MDC Series]**. Original code by Google for this codelab series can be referred [here][MDC Series Repository].

## What one will learn

### Shrine App
In MDC Series 101 to 104, we will build the **Shrine** app which is an e-commerce Android app that sells clothing and home goods. Following are the things one will learn in this series:
* Use of Material Design's `TextInputLayout`, its variants and many useful attributes.
* Use of Material Design's `MaterialButton`, its variants and many useful attributes.
* Use of Material Design's `Top App Bar` as a Navigation pattern.
* Use of Material Design's `MaterialCardView` for displaying similar content on a single subject.
* Creating a custom Horizontal Staggered Grid Layout with multiple item layouts to meet the app's design.
* Theming with colors and styles to customize the UI and express the brand through design.
* Elevation of front surface along with custom shape background to show the presence of a back surface.
* Designing of custom component **"Backdrop Menu"** and its integration with the Toolbar's Navigation Icon, along with appropriate translation motion and Navigation Icon branding.

### Shipping App
In MDC-111, we rewrite the **Shipping** app to incorporate Material Components into the existing codebase. 

## Getting Started

* Android Studio 3.6 or higher with updated SDK and Gradle.
* Android device or emulator running API level 15+.
